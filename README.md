## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for develop and test your robot.

## Prerequisites

You will need a computer with a USB port. 

### Install the Arduino IDE

### ESP32 Arduino Install
https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md


### Library and tools
You will need Library and tool files copied to your Arduino IDE library and tool folders before your project can be compiled.

Copy the folders inside library and tool to the following folders. 

On Windows the default folder is: 
- C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Arduino\libraries
- C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Arduino\tools

On Mac and Linux the default folder is:
- /home/<username>/Arduino/libraries
- /home/<username>/Arduino/tools

If you find your project will not compile and the error is returning a missing library file check and make sure your libraries are in the correct place.
